  I graduated in Software engineering in UPM, Madrid on 2013.
  <br />
  In my courses I took courses on Unix systems, programming where I programmed
  in C++, Java (the main language), some web development and Android
  Applications. The main focus of the major is to the managing part of software
  with courses in Project managaments, agile techniches, design programs,
  Testing, Quality... In the last year I participated in group project as
  intern. In that project I developed a desktop application for refactoring
  source code when a change is made in the SQL queries.
  <br />
  From this internship I wrote the project for my graduation.
  <br />
  <br />
  After that I attended a Master in Computer Engineering , with the
  specialization in Distributed software and services.
  <br />
  Here I attended more specialized classes of Computer Engineering, and new
  cloud technologies, and distributed systems. And I completed an internship in
  a university project as a fullstack developer.
  <br />
  <br />
  Before university, I completed a 2 years profesional formation in Maintenance
  and management of Industrial equipment, where I learn to manage industrial
  equipment, making assurance quality plans, managing development process and
  developing projects where I manage and developed all the stages of a project
  (plannification, development, testing).
